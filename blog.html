    <h1>Question 4</h1>
    <div class="question">
        <h1>Size of elements by using %, em, rem and their effect on browsers</h1>
        <em>Date: 18-March-2020</em>
        <p> 
            There are different units of type size.
            <ul>
                <li>Pixels
                    <ul>
                        <li>Setting font size in pixels is the
                            best way to ensure that the type
                            appears at the size you intended
                            (because percentages and ems
                            are more likely to vary if a user
                            has changed the default size of
                            text in their browser).
                            Pixels are relative to the
                            resolution of the screen, so the
                            same type size will look larger
                            when a screen has a resolution
                            of 800x600 than it would when
                            it is 1280x800.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Percentages
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The default size of text in a
                            web browser is 16 pixels. Using
                            percentages of this amount, you
                            can create a scale where the
                            default text size is 12 pixels, and
                            headings are sized in relation
                            to this.
                            It is possible for users to change
                            the default size of text in their
                            web browsers. If they have
                            done this, the fonts will be
                            displayed at the same scale that
                            the designer intended, but at a
                            larger size.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Ems
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Ems allow you to change the size
                            of text relative to the size of the
                            text in the parent element. Since
                            the default size of text in web
                            browsers is 16 pixels, you can
                            use similar rules to those shown
                            for percentages.
                            Because users can change
                            the default size of text in their
                            browser, the fonts could all
                            appear larger (or smaller) than
                            the designer intended.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Rem
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The main problem with em units is that they are relative
                            to the font size of their own element. As such they can cascade and cause
                            unexpected results. The <q>rem</q> is named as <q>root em</q>. As all the sizes are referenced
                            from the root font size, there is no need to cover the nesting cases in separate declarations.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <img src="assets/image/Capture.PNG" alt="">
            </ul>
            By default browsers usually have a font size 16px, but this can be changed to anywhere from 9px to 72px by the user.

    <h1>Question 5</h1>
    
    <div class="question">
        <h1>What happens when changing the default browser 16px font-size to 200px?</h1>
        <em>Date: 18-March-2020</em>
        <p>
            What really occurs here is that more pixels are added to the default one to increase the size of the 
            text content. The font size property specifies the size, or height, of the font. font-size affects not only the
            font to which it is applied, but also used to compute the value of em, rem length units. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1>Question 6</h1>
    <div class="question">
        <h1>The specific changes in CSS3</h1>
        <em>Date: 18-March-2020</em>
        <p>The specific changes in CSS3 include several new CSS properties.
            Many of these properties create visual styles that would likely associate more graphics program like
            Photoshop. Also, properties like
            border-radius or box-shadow, have been around since the introduction of CSS3. Others, like Flexbox or even
            CSS grid are newer styles that are still often considered CSS3 additions.
            There are three new attribute selectors in CSS3.
            <ul>
                <li>Attribute beginning matches exactly: The element has an attribute called foo that begins with "bar"
                    eg.
                    element[foo^="bar"]
                </li>
                <li>Attribute ending matches exactly: The element has an attribute called foo that ends with "bar"
                    eg. element[foo$="bar"]</li>
                <li>Attribute contains the match: The element has an attribute called foo that contains "bar" eg.
                    element[foo*="bar"]</li>
            </ul>

            There is also 16 new psedo-classes introduced.
            <ul>
                <li>:root
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The root element of the document.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>:nth-child(n)
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Use this match exact child elements or use variables to get alternating matches.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>:nth-of-type(n)
                    <ul>
                        <li>Match sibling elements with the same name before it in the document tree.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>:nth-last-child(n)
                    <ul>
                        <li>Match exact child elements counting up from the last one.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>


                <li>:last-child
                    <ul>
                        <li>Match the last child element of the parent.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>:nth-last-of-type(n)
                    <ul>
                        <li>Match sibling elements with the same name counting up from the bottom.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>:first-of-type
                    <ul>
                        <li>Match the first sibling element of that type.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>:last-of-type
                    <ul>
                        <li>Match the last sibling element of that type.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    :only-child
                    <ul>
                        <li>Match the element that is the only child of its parent.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>:only-of-type
                    <ul>
                        <li>Match the element that is the only one of its type.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>


                <li>:empty
                    <ul>
                        <li>Match the element that has no children(including text nodes).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>:target
                    <ul>
                        <li>Match an element that is the target of the referring URI.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>:enabled
                    <ul>
                        <li>Match the element when it's enabled.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    :disabled
                    <ul>
                        <li>Match the element when it's disabled.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>:checked
                    <ul>
                        <li>Match the element when it's checked(radio button or checkbox).</li>
                    </ul>

                    </ul>

                </li>
            </ul>

            There is one new combinator:
            <ul>
                <li>elementA ~ elementB
                    <ul>
                        <li>Match when elementB follows somewhere after elementA, not neccessarily immediately.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>New Background Style properties</h3>
            There are also some new background properties in CSS3.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Background-Clip
                    <ul>
                        <li>This property defines how the background image should be clipped.
                            The default is the border box, but it can be changed to the padding box or content box.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Background-Origin
                    <ul>
                        <li>This property determines whether the background should be placed in the padding box, the
                            border box, or the content box.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Background-Size
                    <ul>
                        <li>This property indicates the size of the background image. It allows you to strech smaller
                            images to fit the page.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    </div>
